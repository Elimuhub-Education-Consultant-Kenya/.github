*OWASP ® and Security Journey partner to provide OWASP ® members access to
a customized training path focused on OWASP ® Top 10 lists.*

 
Security Journey, the leader in culture-changing web application security training, announces a partnership with OWASP, a nonprofit foundation
that works to improve web application software security. Security Journey has created a
custom belt path for OWASP members covering a wide variety of the content OWASP releases.
The Security Journey training platform, which uses a martial arts-themed belt program to
deliver lessons, includes a unique Security Journey Belt Certification for OWASP® Core Concepts
with lessons for multiple OWASP projects, such as the OWASP Mobile Top 10, OWASP API
Security Top 10, OWASP Proactive Controls, and the OWASP Top 10 2017 and 2021.

To earn the certificate, OWASP members must complete 11 of Security Journey’s OWASP-focused modules
– including a mix of foundational, intermediate, and advanced lessons. The Dojo also includes
four side quests covering Node.JS, Ruby, API, and Mobile security.
“Understanding how to combat the vulnerabilities on the OWASP lists is vital to securing any
web application,” says Security Journey CEO Chris Romeo, “OWASP brings so much value to the
appsec community. We appreciate the opportunity to give back.”  
 

The OWASP Foundation has been operational for nearly two decades, driven by a community of
corporations, foundations, developers, and volunteers passionate about web application
security. As a non-profit, OWASP releases all its’ content for free use to anyone interested in
bettering application security.
