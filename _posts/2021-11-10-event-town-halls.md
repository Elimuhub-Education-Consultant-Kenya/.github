The OWASP Foundation Events Team will be holding three Town Halls across most timezones this coming November 30.

<!--more-->

We need to brief OWASP Event leaders on recent changes to events policy, how to efficiently run an AppSec Days regional event, how to budget and submit expenses, and discuss the new OWASPx event type. The remainder of the time will be used to listen and discuss event leader questions or topics. These sessions will be recorded.

If you have event related questions you'd like us to address, please contact Lauren Thomas (lauren.thomas@owasp.com) to ensure that we cover it off either in our presentation or as a discussion point during the session itself.
