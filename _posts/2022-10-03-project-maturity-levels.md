title: Introducing new "Production" project maturity level
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

In order to distinguish [projects](https://owasp.org/projects/) more clearly over their lifecycle, OWASP has introduced a new _Production_ maturity level. It offers a natural and final step for all projects of sufficient maturity and activity after _Lab_ status, and allows to treat _Flagship_ finally as the strategic bonus level it was always meant to be. Along with the new level, a clear guidance on progression requirements and the promotion process have been documented by [the Project Committee](https://owasp.org/www-committee-project/).

## OWASP Project Maturity Levels

All new OWASP projects start at the _Incubator_ level, on which they are considered experimental, proof-of-concept, work-in-progress, or sometimes just an idea. Once proven themselves with a stable release, introduction of good open source development & maintenance practices and being received positively by the community, projects would request promotion to _Lab_ level. Up until now, this was the end of the line for many projects, as the _Flagship_ level has been scarecely awared to projects of strategic value to the OWASP mission. Ending up on a level called _Lab_ felt somewhat unnatural for very mature and active projects. Entering: _Production_ level.

_Production_ is now the final step in the possible maturity progression for OWASP projects. It comes with tougher requirements, but allows to clearly distinguish OWASP's top-of-the-line projects. This new level finally allows to clearly disconnect _Flagship_ from the maturity scale, and consider such projects simply as _Production_ level maturity with a bonus award for strategic importance.        

## Progression Requirements and Process

The requirements for maturity promotions were a bit fuzzy up until now. The Project Committee has changed this by providing [a clear overview of necessary prerequisites for each level](https://owasp.org/www-committee-project/#div-promotions). The promotion request & review process itself is now also very straightforward.

    <i class="fas fa-flask fa-2x" style="color:#FFA500"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-right fa-2x"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-city fa-2x" style="color:#800080"></i>
</p>

For _Incubator_ to _Lab_ and further to _Production_, a Google form is available to request the promotion. The request is reviewed by at least one Project Committee member and one volunteer project leader or second Project Committee member. The final decision about the promotion is with the Project Committee. In case of declined promotion requests, the committee will provide a list of findings and shortcomings to the requesting Project Leader, so that they can address them and reapply for promotion later.

    <i class="fas fa-flag fa-2x" style="color:#38a047"></i>
</p>

Strategic promotions to _Flagship_ level can be proposed to the Project Committee [directly via email](mailto:project-committee@owasp.org). Such proposals will be evaluated by the Project Committee and a recommendation brought to the OWASP Global Board. The final decision is with the Board.

## OWASP Project Good Practices

A significant aspect of [the promotion checklist](https://owasp.org/www-committee-project/#div-promotions) is how well a project considers the recently published [OWASP Project Good Practices](https://owasp.org/www-committee-project/#div-practice). These currently include advice on vendor neutrality, community support, website upkeep, and usage of GitHub. This Good Practices checklist is supposed to be extended over time and as frequently as needed. The goal is to provide practical guidance and relevant practices for projects, rather than a high-level ruleset. Leaders should still assume, that an abstracted form of these practices will one day make their way into the [Project Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/projects).
