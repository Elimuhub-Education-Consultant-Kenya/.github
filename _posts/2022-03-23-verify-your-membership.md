title: OWASP Membership Data Cleanup - please verify your membership
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

Over the last few months, many have received a great deal of communication about their impending email deactivation. For most of the accounts affected, this is actually what was supposed to have happened a long time ago, because as members expire, their accounts should be de-activated. The issue is that some members have multiple records or incorrect data. This automation is will processing expired memberships as an on going process. The process will eventually find all incorrect membership data. This process only deactivates the account, and so it's very easy for us to get things back on the right track.

We need your help. Our call to action is every member should login to the [OWASP Membership portal](https://members.owasp.org) with your owasp.org email address, review, and as necessary update their membership data and contact preferences. Please update your membership record. If you can't login, please [log a support ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/9).

## Call to Action - Please verify and update your data

We need your help to test and correct your data.

Deactivation warnings are being sent and then deactivation happens to members who might have a current OWASP membership. Data quality is a shared responsbility between OWASP and our members: OWASP needs to maintain an accurate single source of truth, and our members need to maintain their own data. In the past, issues crept in that allowed for multiple records, and many members never updated incorrect data. As we move to a new AMS, we have to clean up our data, but additionally, right now, we want to ensure all current members have access to their GSuite account, and to clean up expired memberships and incorrect records.

Please login to the [OWASP Membership portal](https://members.owasp.org) with your owasp.org email address, review, and as necessary update your membership data and contact preferences.

If you can't login, please [log a support ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/9).

If you do not currently have an owasp.org email address and are a member, you can provision one at [Manage Membership](https://owasp.org/manage-membership/)

If you have questions that do not require an immediate answer or resolution you can also send an email to [OWASP Membership](mailto:membership@owasp.com). Without exception, logging tickets is the fastest and most reliable way to get help.

## We will continue to support you

First things first - for most of those affected, it is somewhat likely that you need to renew your membership. If that's the case, please renew. Renewing will automatically re-enable your account.

For everyone else, don't worry, you won't lose any data. We will process support tickets and get things fixed up, and that should resolve the issue once and for all (we hope!). If anyone's standing for the Global Board elections is affected, we will fix that.

We have been working behind the scenes to improve OWASP membership data, looking for likely duplicate records. All the easily matchable records have been merged for a month or more. We are now looking into doing fuzzy name and email searches to identify likely similar accounts, but if the names are sufficiently different or email addresses wildly different, there will still be records that we don't yet know about.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to [log a support ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/9), [reach out to me](mailto:andrew.vanderstock@owasp.com), [OWASP Membership](mailto:membership@owasp.com).
