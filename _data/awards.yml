      Each year there are many individuals who do amazing work, dedicating countless hours to share, improve, 
      and strengthen the OWASP mission. Some of these individuals are well known to the community while others are not.  
      The purpose of these awards is to bring recognition to those who "FLY UNDER THE RADAR". These are the individuals 
      who are passionate about OWASP, who contribute hours of their own free time to the organization to help improve 
      the cyber-security world, yet seem to go unrecognized.
