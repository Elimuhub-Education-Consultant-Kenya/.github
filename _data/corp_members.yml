  description: "To remain competitive, organizations need to accelerate business transformation in order to deliver products faster. This leaves development teams with a choice: delay feature releases until security reviews can be performed or release new code with security risks. These teams lack the contextual understanding of their application components, risks, and developers necessary to make informed decisions. Apiiro is the industry-first Code Risk Platform™ to automate visibility, assurance, and risk remediation, across applications and infrastructure, before production. Only Apiiro enables organizations to deliver faster by identifying material code changes to enable teams to have a holistic, context-driven understanding of application risk."

      RapidFort is the first Software Attack Surface Optimization Platform. Modern cloud workloads include a large number of unused components. Current products that are in the market can only identify & list vulnerabilities. It is the responsibility of the dev team to address these vulnerabilities. Since there are typically 1000s of vulnerabilities in a typical s/w, it is impossible to address all of them. However, RapidFort's revolutionary product profiles the s/w during runtime, identifies packages/files that are unused and then automatically removes them. By removing all the vulnerabilities associated with those files, it makes s/w secure as well as increases productivity.
